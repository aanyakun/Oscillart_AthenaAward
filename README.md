# Oscillart: Visual & Audio Waves!
How Long this Took: This project took me about 10 hours (including days for coding & styling and also debugging/testing which took quite some while)
Languages/Tools:
-HTML5 (for structing my site)
-CSS (styling my site to look pretty and unique!)
-JavaScript (coding for the drawing of sine waves + generating sounds)
-MediaRecorderAPI (recording the canvas & audio)

How a user should use my web-app:
1. Enter notes in the text box between letters A-G (ex: CDEFGAB)
2. Click the button, Submit me please :)
3. Watch and see your notes turn into a sine wave while also hearing some sound!!
4. Customize your experience as best fit for you:
   -Change wave color using the color picker
   -Adjust volume using the slider
   -Adjust line thickness for bolder or thinner waves
   -Switch waveform type (sine, triangle, square, sawtooth)
5. Optional: Click Start Recording!!

Why This Project Interested Me:
I found it really cool that I could explore the intersection of music + visuals — how we can truly see sound! I also wanted to get more experience with creative coding tools like Github CodeSpaces + working with languages I know (JS, HTML, CSS).

Features I’m Proud Of:
-User Customizable inputs: color picker, volume slider, line thickness slider, waveform dropdown.
-Recording feature that captures audio & visuals
